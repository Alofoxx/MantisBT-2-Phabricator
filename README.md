# MantisBT-2-Phabricator
Migrate data from a Mantis Bug Tracker database into a Phabricator [Maniphest] installation.

This project was made to provide a usefull tool to help migrate data from a Mantis Bug Tracker database into a Phabricator installation via Conduit (the Phabricator API).

I made this for my own org to move to Phabricator so the functionaly is mainly driven by what we needed to transfer. I make no warranty that this code will work in the way you may need it to. Or that it wont blow up your server. Or that its complete. Or that it will be updated. So don't blame me.

(should work though!)

I'm not against keeping it alive/updated/improving. Just low priority for me.
